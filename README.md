### Create, Download and Save your private key. This is usually saved in your Download folder as .pem file 
## Connecting to your Ec2 instance
### Copy the public ip address on your Ec2 instance created on your AWS account.
### On your computer terminal navigate to your download folder or any folder you have saved your private key file that was downloaded.
### When in the folder you can ssh into your Ec2 instance by running this command ***ssh -i <private-key-name>.pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>***
### **NOTE** -Anywhere you see these anchor tags <>, it should be replaced with the value specific to your situation. Example, if the private key you downloaded was named **my-private-key.pem**, simply remove the anchor tags and insert **my-private-key.pem** in the command you are required to execute.
